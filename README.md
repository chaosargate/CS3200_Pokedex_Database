# CS3200_Pokedex_Database
A Pokemon-inspired database project for a Database Design course created with a JavaScript front end and a Python back end. Created by Aaron Hoang and Matthew Manomivibul for the Fall 2015 semester.

The back end is done as a simple HTTP server that the front end makes requests to. The server makes and processes SQL queries based on the requests made by the front end and serves the processed results to the front end as a formatted HTML table. The front end allows end-users to filter Pokemon by various categories and allows for users to update the system with new Pokemon and info for them. The front end was designed to be run via an Apache web server, while the main back end script can be run as-is as long as the proper libraries are installed.
